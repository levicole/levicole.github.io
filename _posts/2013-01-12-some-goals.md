title: Some Goals for 2013
---

2013 is going to be about accomplishing some goals. It's been said that a goal without a plan is just a wish. Well, I'm tired of my wishes not coming true, so I'm doing things right this year. Well, at least as good as I can.

Last year I had one simple goal: make a video game. Well, I didn't succeed, but thats ok, I'm going to let that one roll over. Here's my list of goals for 2013:

* Make a game
* Read more (not just programming books)
* Ship a product of my own
* Break even on that product
* Spend more quality time with my wife.
* Reach 185 lbs.
* Write
* Work on open source more

It's a pretty ambitious list, especially 3 and 4, but I think I can do it.
